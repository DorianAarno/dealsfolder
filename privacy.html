    </p>
    <h2>When do we collect information?</h2>
    <p>
       We collect the information when you click on our links and purchase a product from our listings.
    </p>
    <h2>How do we use your information?</h2>
    <p>
        Our affiliate partners may use the information we collect from you when you make a purchase in the following ways:
        1. To identify leads, trying to determine what devices are likely to belong to you and trying to distinguish your device from other devices, to provide us commission accurately. 
        2. Performance measurement, reporting and analytics related to the services provided under our Agreement with our affiliate partners.
        3. Improve existing systems and software and to develop new products.
        4. Monitor for and prevent fraudulent activity as well as ensuring systems and processes work properly and securely (the "Permitted Purposes"). 
        5. As otherwise might be disclosed at the time of collection.
    </p>
    <h2>Third-party disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.
    </p>
    <h2>Third-party links</h2>
    <p>
        Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies & Web Beacons</h2>
    <p>
        DealsFolder, its advertisers or analytics partners may send a cookie to your computer or use web beacons to gather statistical information. A cookie does not personally identify you. It is simply a way to know that a particular web browser was used to visit our sites. A web beacon does not personally identify you. It is simply a way to automatically send information about pages and content used to an analysis tool.

        Cookies and web beacons allows us to understand things such as whether a particular web browser is spending much time on our sites, visiting several times per month and other types of analysis. If you don’t provide us with personally identifiable information, then your visits – despite us using cookies or web beacons – are anonymous. We don’t know the identity of people linked with cookies. It’s like having a library card but never having to provide your name, address or phone number to check out books. The books are checked out by someone using a particular library card number, but who owns that number isn’t known. If you provide personally identifiable information, then we may link that information with your cookie, and gather the visits with web beacons and understand how you personally have acted when visiting our web site.

        Advertisers may also use cookies and web beacons to ascertain how many times you’ve seen an advertisement. No personally identifiable information you give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so they cannot personally identify you with that information on our web sites. Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions shouldn’t cause a problem with our sites, should you so choose. If you do encounter a problem, please let us know.
    </p>
    <h2>Opting Out</h2>
    <p>
        You may opt out anytime by disabling cookies in your browser but if you turn cookies off, some of the features that make your site experience more efficient may not function properly. 
    </p>
    <h2>Our Socials</h2>
    <p>
        We post our listings otherwise known as deals in our socials including but not limited to telegram and discord. At the time you enter them, you will be prompted with our privacy policy, hence, your presence in our network indicates that you have read and accepted our policy.
    </p>
    <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
    <p>
        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
    </p>
    <h2>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following</h2>
    <p>
        Users can visit our site anonymously.

        Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.

        Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.

        You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page and/or via our socials.
    </p>
    <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 16 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.

        We do not specifically market to children under the age of 16 years old.
